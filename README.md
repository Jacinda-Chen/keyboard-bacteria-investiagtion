**Overview**

This project explores bacterial presence and diversity on computer keyboards within a university setting, comparing communal (shared) and individual (personal) usage environments. Both cultured and culture-free data were analyzed to assess microbial abundance and diversity, with a focus on potential health implications in high-touch environments.

---

**Objective**

To determine whether there are significant differences in bacterial diversity and abundance between communal and individual computer keyboards using both culture-based and DNA sequencing (culture-free) methods.

---

**Key Findings**

Shared Genera: Many bacterial genera were found across both sample groups. For example:

Staphylococcus was found on both communal (2F) and individual (6Fp) keyboards.

Bacillus was also shared between communal (3F) and individual (5F) keyboards.

Alpha Diversity: No statistically significant difference in species richness or diversity (Shannon & Simpson indices) between sample groups was observed.
(Wilcoxon p = 0.7 for all measures)

Colony Abundance: A significantly higher number of bacterial colonies were found on communal keyboards.
(Wilcoxon p = 0.02)

---

**Interpretation**

While microbial diversity did not differ significantly between communal and individual keyboards, colony-forming units (living bacteria under culturable conditions) were more abundant on communal devices. This suggests communal keyboards may harbor more viable bacteria, potentially due to:

Higher traffic from multiple users

Increased food residue and contact frequency

---

**Health Implications**

Most detected bacteria were common skin flora (e.g., Staphylococcus spp.) and are not typically harmful to healthy individuals. However, for immunocompromised individuals, regular cleaning and hygiene practices are essential, as even non-pathogenic microbes can pose risks.

---

**Future Work**

Test bacterial growth under different culture conditions (e.g., anaerobic, alternative nutrients).

Include additional metadata such as time of day, cleaning frequency, and environmental conditions.

Explore antimicrobial surface treatments or behavioral interventions to reduce microbial load.
